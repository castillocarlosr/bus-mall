<!-- Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.

As a reminder, user stories typically take the form of, "As X, I want Y, so that Z" but do not necessarily need that structure.

A wise student would take about 30-45 minutes to work on the user stories and also draft a technical plan for the project (a detailed to-do list of things to make, step by step and tested at each stage) before getting into the code. That time spent in thought and planning will make the code flow a lot faster. Give yourself a series of little problems to solve (rather an a ginormous thing that you just wade through and poke at).

Set 'em up, and knock 'em down.

Plan your work, and work your plan. -->


Marketing member1:  "As a marketer, I want to make sell my products to as many people as possible."

Research member1:  "As a researcher, I need a way to gather information on what my customers want."
Research member1:  "I want to find ways to gather my customers wants and needs"
Research member1:  "Gather analytics and use that to influence customers to buy"
Research member1:  "Gather analytics in a nice format to plan what to do with that data"

Developer member1:  "As a developer, I want my code to run smoothly"
Developer member2:  "I need my code to be effective but not overbearing to the user"
Developer member3:  "A functional code is important.  But needs to be capable of easy changes"
Developer member4:  "I want my code to be readable and still work for the marketer and research teams"
