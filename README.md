# Project Title

Bus Mall Catalog  

## About

This is my personal project for Class Code 201.  Created back in 2018.
This is an application to practice my javascript in using event listeners, random number generator for images, displaying results in a graph, and using local storage. 

### How this works:

When you open index.html the javascript should run to show a survey of three pictures to choose from in the bus mall.  Go through 25 and results should appear of the 25 items that were clicked.

##Note:

There are times that github will create a 404 error when displaying the images but work fine on heroku or live-server.
